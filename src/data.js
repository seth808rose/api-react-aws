    info: "Hello and welcome to my beer api project. Tools used for this project are Reactjs as the frontend and AWS Amplify for the backend. Amplify is used for hosting and authentication. At the bottom of the 'Beer api section, youll find a button that has the scroll to top functionality which was pretty fun in it of itself. I also used 'react-router' for page routing etc. I wanted to showcase my skills by calling a random API url found off the net and by using async await and fetch functionality to call the beer data to the ui. Styles with basic CSS styling and what we get is a beer collection with the beers including their names, description, tagline along with an ugly image of the beer bottle. Fortunatly for this project, pixel perfect images wasn't the main goal here but more or less the API functionality ties together with a backend and authenticated sign in process.",
